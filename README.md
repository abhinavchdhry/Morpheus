# Morpheus
A simplistic implementation of a group expense splitting algorithm.
Modularized for C++ and Python

ARCHITECTURE:
1. Library will be written in C++ and compiled as a shared object.
2. PHP(for web-based interface), iOS and Android-NDK wrappers on top of the C++ library

## To Do
1. Need to add main.cpp in C++ Directory to run the driver program.
2. Check for errors in other files.
3. make or make all will generate the library and binary.
4. Just run make clean to remove the generated obj files.
